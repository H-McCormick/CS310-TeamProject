This program is a clock-in clock-out system for a company that has a large number of employees.
This program aims to make employees' total amount of earned time over the week match the same amount of hours that they were scheduled. 
This program allows employees to clock in and out of the system while keeping track of there total amount of hours earned in a week. 
A grace period time is incorporated into this system that pushes a employee's time forward or back in order to have the time that they clocked in match the time they were supposed to come into work. 
This grace period is a 5 minute time limit before and after the start of the shift, as well as 5 minutes before and after the end of the shift. 
For example, if an employee is scheduled to work at 9:00am and they clock in at 8:57am, the systems will push that employee's clock in time forward to 9:00am instead of 8:57am in order to avoid giving employees extra time. 
If an employee were to clock in at 9:02am in this same example, then their clock in time would be pushed back to 9:00am
This works the same way when the employee goes to clock out of the system. 
This program also takes into account the same system if an employee has a scheduled lunch break.
